      "FinalAscPumpT": "Final Upstroke Pump Impact",
      "FinalAscPumpC": "The dynagraph chart describes a dirt problem in a pump, listing the main causes as solid particles and organic residues in the pumped liquid. It also lists wear and corrosion of internal components as contributing factors.",
      "FinalDesPumpT": "Final Downstroke Pump Impact",
      "FinalDesPumpC": "The dynagraph chart describes a pump impact on the final downstroke, occurring when the piston or plunger of the pump strikes forcefully at its lowest point, generating vibrations and potential damage to components. It may be due to insufficient damping, high operating speed, or wear in internal mechanisms.",
      "DamagedPumpT": "Severely Damaged Pump",
      "DamagedPumpC": "The dynagraph chart describes a severely damaged pump with component failures due to factors such as extreme wear, corrosion, cavitation, or impact from solid particles. This can reduce its efficiency, cause leaks, and affect the performance of the system in which it operates.",
      "FullPumpT": "Full Pump",
      "FullPumpC": "A dynagraph chart of a full pump describes the state in which the pump is fully loaded with fluid, without cavitation or air bubbles in the system. This indicates that the pump is operating under optimal conditions, with steady and efficient flow. In this state, there are no performance drops or air-related problems, helping to prevent damage to the pump’s internal components.",
      "TravelLeakT": "Traveling Valve Leak",
      "TravelLeakC": "The dynagraph chart of a leak in the traveling valve describes a loss of pressure or fluid through the valve during operation. This leak may be caused by wear, corrosion, or seal failure. It is specified that the leak reduces system efficiency, causing possible fluid loss and disruptions in process control.",
      "FixedLeakT": "Standing Valve Leak",
      "FixedLeakC": "The dynagraph chart of a leak in the standing valve describes fluid loss through the valve due to seal defects or wear of internal components. This leak can cause a decrease in system pressure, affecting its efficiency and performance. Possible causes include corrosion, residue buildup, or installation failures.",
      "GasInterferenceT": "Gas Interference",
      "GasInterferenceC": "The dynagraph chart of gas interference describes a problem where the presence of gas in the pumping system negatively affects fluid flow. This interference can cause cavitation, reduced pumping capacity, and pressure fluctuations, compromising the system’s efficiency. Common causes include gas intake from the reservoir or fluid degassing.",
      "FluidShockT": "Fluid Hammer",
      "FluidShockC": "The dynagraph chart of fluid hammer describes an event where a sudden change in fluid flow velocity causes a sharp increase in pressure within the system. This phenomenon, known as water hammer, can damage pipes, valves, and other components due to excessive pressure. The most common causes include the rapid closing of valves or the sudden stoppage of flow."
